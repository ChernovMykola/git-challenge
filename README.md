## My story
Hello! My name is Mykola and I want to say my story for you. It is very interesting story from my life and it is about my first day in Ukraine when war started.
We be in Sumy. It is a city which located around the border with Russia. And we did nit know about war, because we are sleeped.
And when we are get up we think that we can went to training but my mother had other think about it and we packed up and went home very fast and we did not know what will happened with us in future.
