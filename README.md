## My story
Hello! My name is Mykola and I want to say my story for you. It is very interesting story from my life and it is about my first day in Ukraine when war started.
We be in Sumy. It is a city which located around the border with Russia. And we did nit know about war, because we are sleeped.
And when we are get up we think that we can went to training but my mother had other think about it and we packed up and went home very fast and we did not know what will happened with us in future.

I decided to pack and move on. War was not gonna stop me.
Even if i had to start from scratch abroad, I wanted to keep going. 
And this how my journey started.

As I packed my bags, I couldn't help but feel scared and uncertain about what the future held. I knew that the war in Ukraine was getting worse, and I was worried about my family's safety.

But at the same time, I was determined to keep moving forward. I didn't want to be held back by the violence and chaos that was engulfing my country. So, I made the difficult decision to leave and start a new life abroad.
